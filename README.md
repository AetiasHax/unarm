# unarm

Disassembler for the ARM instruction set, inspired by [ppc750cl](https://github.com/encounter/ppc750cl). It currently supports
the following versions:

- ARMv4T
- ARMv5TE
- ARMv6K

## Disassemblers

The [`/disasm/`](/disasm/) module has disassemblers for ARM and Thumb instructions of the supported versions of ARM.

- They are generated from `arm.yaml` files in the [`/specs/`](/specs/) directory by the [`/generator/`](/generator/) module.
- They accept all 2^32 possible ARM instructions and 2^16 Thumb instructions without errors.
- No promises that the output is 100% correct.
  - Some illegal instructions may not be parsed as illegal.
  - Some instructions may not stringify correctly.
  - (more, probably)

### Performance (ARM)

Tested on all 2^32 ARM instructions in each supported version using the [`/fuzz/`](/fuzz/) module on a single thread:

- AMD Ryzen 7 7700X: 160 million insn/s (~610 MB/s)

### Performance (Thumb)

Tested on all 2^16 Thumb instructions in each supported version using the [`/fuzz/`](/fuzz/) module on a single thread,
averaged after 100,000 iterations:

- AMD Ryzen 7 7700X: 300 million insn/s (~572 MB/s)

## Usage

Below is an example of using `unarm` to parse an ARMv5TE instruction.

```rust
use unarm::{args::*, v5te::arm::{Ins, Opcode}};

let ins = Ins::new(0xe5902268, &Default::default());
assert_eq!(ins.op, Opcode::Ldr);

let parsed = ins.parse(&Default::default());
assert_eq!(
    parsed.args[0],
    Argument::Reg(Reg { reg: Register::R2, deref: false, writeback: false })
);
assert_eq!(
    parsed.args[1],
    Argument::Reg(Reg { reg: Register::R0, deref: true, writeback: false })
);
assert!(matches!(
    parsed.args[2],
    Argument::OffsetImm(OffsetImm { value: 0x268, post_indexed: false })
));
assert_eq!(parsed.display(Default::default()).to_string(), "ldr r2, [r0, #0x268]");
```

### 32-bit Thumb instructions

Thumb uses 16-bit instructions, trading a subset of ARM instructions for smaller code size. However, this leaves little room
for BL/BLX target offsets. This would mean that function calls further than ±1KB away would only be possible using
a register as target address, which could take 3 or 4 instructions in total.

To solve this, Thumb includes "32-bit" BL and BLX instructions with a maximum offset of ±4MB. In truth, these are just two
16-bit instructions strung together. For BL, we call them `Opcode::BlH` and `Opcode::Bl`. For BLX, we call them `Opcode::BlH`
and `Opcode::BlxI`. The first instruction is the same for BL and BLX.

To tell if an instruction needs to be combined, you can use `Ins::is_half_bl(&self)`, which simply checks if the opcode is
`Opcode::BlH`. To combine two instructions into a BL/BLX, use `ParsedIns::combine_thumb_bl(&self, second: &Self)`.
